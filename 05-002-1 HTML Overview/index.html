    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite hobbies as a child was <b>reading</b>. I remember
      spending countless hours immersed in fantasy worlds, imagining myself as
      the hero of the story.

    <h2>Outdoor Play</h2>
    <p>
      I also loved playing <b>outdoors</b> with my friends. We would explore the
      neighbourhood, build forts, and play imaginative games until the sun went
      down.

    <h2>LEGO</h2>
    <p>
      <b>LEGO</b> was one of my favorite toys growing up. I enjoyed building
      elaborate structures and letting my imagination run wild with endless
      possibilities.

    <h2>Toy Cars</h2>
    <p>
      Another toy I cherished was my collection of <b>toy cars</b>. I spent
      hours racing them around imaginary tracks and staging epic car chases.
